## üîß Installation for development

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/BioMarkerImaging/SelerSightAI`

   `cd celer-sight-ai`
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Windows**:

      `
      python -m venv .venv`

      `.venv\Scripts\activate`

   **macOS/Linux**:

      `python -m venv .venv`

      `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:

   `
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -v -e .
   `

## Model training / inference is expensive, how can this be free?
Initially, all users will have access to cloud compute, however, within the next year this will change. For free users Celer Sight will download version of the requested models and they will run on the users laptop. This way of serving models allow us to handle ai model inference for free! If you still need cloud inference though, there will be a paid option available for those who can support it.
