## üîß Installation for development

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone https://github.com/BioMarkerImaging/SelerSightAI`

   `cd celer-sight-ai`
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Windows**:

      `
      python -m venv .venv`

      `.venv\Scripts\activate`

   **macOS/Linux**:

      `python -m venv .venv`

      `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:

   `
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -v -e .
   `

## Model training / inference is expensive, how can this be free?
Initially, all users will have access to cloud compute, however, within the next year this will change. For free users Celer Sight will download a version of the requested model automatically and run inference on users machine in the background. If you still need cloud inference, there will be a paid option available for those who can support it.

### Current Model (Beta)

* Cloud inference available to all users
* Zero data retention policy
* No image or metadata storage
* Daily limit to all users, with an increased limit to patreon members

## Upcoming Tiers (2025)
###  Free Tier
* Local inference by default
* Potential cloud inference during low-traffic periods
* Access to all community models
* Community model contributions
  
### Premium Tier
* Priority cloud inference
* Private model development possible
* Dedicated processing resources
* Premium support access
